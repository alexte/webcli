# WebCli

This is a small library that you can use to add a Comand Line Interface (CLI) to your
webapplication. It's like a line oriented console interface in the web browser.

See the sample.html file, for usage of this library.

This library uses jquery. If you need a non jquery version, you may ask or fix it your self.
